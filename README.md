# Precision-Fruit-Quality-Assessment-with-YOLOv8-and-IoT-Optimizing-Food-Safety
This Project proposes a system YOLOv8-based object detection to assess fruit quality. It enables real-time classification of fruits as fresh, mid, or degraded, supporting automated monitoring to reduce spoilage, improve food safety, and enhance supply chain efficiency.
